# IST687 â€“ HW 11  - Wielding the tm package and counting words

#Part A: Load and condition the text file that contains the speech  
#1.	The data is available on blackboard, as a JSON file (see HW8 if you need a reminder on the dataset or how to load the dataset).

hotelData<-fromJSON("hotelSurveyBarriot.json")
hotelSurvey<-as.data.frame(hotelData)
str(hotelSurvey)

#2.	The key column to focus on is the ???freeText??? column.

hotelSurvey$freeText
View(hotelSurvey)

#Part B: Create a list of word counts from the speech
#3.	Starting with the code at the bottom of page 180 in the text book, use a similar approach to transform the free text into a term document matrix, and then determine positive and negative word matches.

words.vec <- VectorSource(hotelSurvey$freeText)
words.corpus <- Corpus(words.vec)

library(wordcloud)

pos <- "positive-words.txt"
neg <- "negative-words.txt"

p <- scan(pos, character(0),sep = "\n")
n <- scan(neg, character(0),sep = "\n")


p <- p[-1:-34] 
n <- n[-1:-34] 
head(p)


words <- names(wordCounts)
#Matching words with positive word list 
pmatched <- match(words, p, nomatch = 0)
head(pmatched)
words[6]
p[772]


#Selecting words which match with positive word list
mCounts <- wordCounts[which(pmatched != 0)] 
mCounts_df<-as.data.frame(mCounts)
names(mCounts_df)<-c("occurance")
mWords <- names(mCounts)
nPos<-sum(mCounts)


#Similar approach is followed for matching negative words
nmatched <- match(words, n, nomatch = 0)



nCounts <- wordCounts[which(nmatched != 0)] 
nCounts_df<-as.data.frame(nCounts)
names(nCounts_df)<-c("occurance")
nWords <- names(nCounts)
nNeg<-sum(nCounts)
#total number of words present in words vector
totalWords<-length(words)

#4.Calculate the percent positive words and negative words.
ratioPos <- nPos/totalWords
ratioPosPercent<-ratioPos*100
ratioNeg <- nNeg/totalWords
ratioNegPercent<-ratioNeg*100
#Percent Positive Words 
ratioPosPercent
#Percent Negative Words 
ratioNegPercent
ratioPos
ratioNeg

#5.	Write a block comment that summarizes what you learned from ratioPos and ratioNeg.

#So the ratio of Positive words is 0.308 which is way higher than the ratio of Negative words that is 0.079
#This shows that there are many Positive words in the Free Text column of the Dataset which shows that the Customers have given a Positive feedback.

#Part D: Visualize the results
#6.	Create a word cloud

cloudFrame<-data.frame(word=names(wordCounts),freq=wordCounts) 
wordcloud(cloudFrame$word,cloudFrame$freq)

#7.	Create a barplot of the positive and negative words that matched (at least twice)

library(ggplot2)
ggplot (mCounts_df,aes(x=rownames(mCounts_df),y=occurance))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1))+
  xlab("Positive Words in Comments")+
  ylab("Count")

ggplot (nCounts_df,aes(x=rownames(nCounts_df),y=occurance))+
  geom_bar(stat='identity')+
  theme(axis.text.x=element_text(angle=90,hjust=1))+
  xlab("Negative Words in Comments")+
  ylab("Count")

#8.	Write a block comment on what you observe from these two barplots and the wordcloud. 
#Looking at the wordcloud, I've observed that the word cloud shows most of the positive words
#which makes it visually appealing.
#Looking at the two barplots, I've observed that there are way more positive words than the negative words 
#And also that we can view the exact count of each and every positive and negative words used in FreeText.

#9.	Does these results make sense to you in terms of the kinds of emotions you see?
#Which do you think is more informative ??? barplot or the wordcloud?
#Yes, the results show that the feedback given in FreeText was positive.
#I think barplot is more informative as it gives us a clear picture as what are the positive and negative words used in comment along with their count.

#Part E: Evaluate Happy and not Happy customer responses

#10.	Create two subset of the text vectors: one for happy customers and one for not happy customers (based on overall customer satisfaction).
#11.	Redo Steps B, C & D, for these two subsets of the text strings.
